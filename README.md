# Ayanabot

Twitter bot is shut down but feel free to clone this and make it your own

In this program I am using the [tweepy API](https://www.tweepy.org/) 

## How to use
To use my bot at the moment you have to mention me [@tehpson](https://twitter.com/tehpson) and use #Ayanabot and theb type your command
here is a lost of command currently in progress
1. hello/hi -- it simply replies back to you
2. !power -- show what power you are on
3. !attack *@user* -- attack the user you mantion if they is connectet to the bot
4. !raidstatus -- show the status if raid is ongoing or how long until next raid begin
5. !raid *power* -- add power to defend agienst the raid where power id the amount you want add
6. !slot *amount* -- gamble is good? 

Being connected simply mean that you have been using #Ayanabot atleast once


## Plans for futer
* ~~Finish raid system~~ (Beta)
    * make so you get more power if "help" out more
* Make ***attack*** to be more fair  
* Add bot/minigame to own twitter acc instead of using my private acc
* Make more ways to gain power
* ~~*Add slot* ??~~
    * Have to fix the odds
* change so the credencials are in the connect.(py) istead of dev.(ini) so hta I can sheare dev.(ini)

## Known Bugs
* crashes uppon trying to send the same think twice
* twitter thinks I'm spaming (could be coz I am using my privv acc to test on should help if I place it on a own acc)
